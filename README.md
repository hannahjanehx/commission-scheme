mui install is causing an error - can see its in node_modules\@mui\x-charts\models\seriesType\pie.d.ts file in the value type, but i cannot change that. Fix I believe is to just change that to value: string | number

external installs used:
@emotion/styled
@emotion/react
@mui/x-data-grid
@mui/x-charts
